The old cli version is on /oldCliVer directory. Files on root of repo is for VS to bulid this cipher app with gui that's made in in wx widgets. That's required to link wxwidgets libs before compiling. The interface is terrible, but the ciphering method and gui layout is not a point of this project. On next I will try using cmake for easier building on other machines. But now i gave a compiled version for windows in releses.
