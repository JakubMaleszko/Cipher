# Quck note
The old CLI version is in the /oldCliVer directory. The files at the root of the repository are for Visual Studio to build this cipher app with a GUI made using wxWidgets. This is necessary to link the wxWidgets libraries before compilation. The interface is terrible, but the focus of this project is not on the ciphering method or GUI layout. Next, I will try using CMake for easier building on other machines. For now, I've provided a compiled Windows version in the releases folder.
## Versions
